##613. Shortest Distance in a Line
Table point holds the x coordinate of some points on x-axis in a plane, which are all integers.
 

Write a query to find the shortest distance between two points in these points.
 

| x   |
|-----|
| -1  |
| 0   |
| 2   |
 

The shortest distance is '1' obviously, which is from point '-1' to '0'. So the output is as below:
 

| shortest|
|---------|
| 1       |


Solution:
# Write your MySQL query statement below
SELECT    abs(a.x - b.x) AS shortest
FROM      point AS a, point AS b
WHERE     a.x != b.x
ORDER BY  shortest
LIMIT     1
